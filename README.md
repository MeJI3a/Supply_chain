# Supply Chain Analysis Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain data stored in a relational database. The focus is on identifying inefficiencies, evaluating delivery performance, and providing actionable insights for improvement. The database includes tables for customers, orders, products, shipping, and order items.

## Key Objectives
- Evaluate delivery performance.
- Analyze late delivery trends by region and shipping mode.
- Identify high-value customers.
- Assess seasonal demand trends.
- Identify profitable product categories.
